# HLA_Infection_Association_Model_White_et_al_2020
Matlab code for the ODE model in "Detecting HLA-infectious disease associations for multi-strain pathogens" 

In this repository there are two ode models, used in the paper "Detecting HLA-infectious disease associations for multi-strain pathogens" Connor F White, Lorenzo Pellis, Matt J Keeling and Bridget S Penman. These are the two pathogen and three pathogen models. To run each you will need to run "Two_Pathogen_Model_Simple.m" or "Three_Pathogen_Model_Simple.m
